# 05-Space-shooter
Within this file I have created a very simple 2D space shooter game. When running the file in the terminal you can play the game. User control the spaceship with the mouse and click the mouse to fire bullets at the enemy. The enemies can shoot and kill you though. Within the file main.py is where I have entered code that allows the game to run how it does. Mostly by creating definitions so that I can run a functions through that definition. Enjoy!
