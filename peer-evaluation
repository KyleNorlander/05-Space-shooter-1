Project: Space Shooters
Peer's repository: https://github.com/tannerbender/05-Space-shooter



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project? I think you could have found some more assets or a background picture as opposed to the blank background. 

 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects? I saw you had good positioning for your bullets spawn in relation to the players ship, maybe copy/paste the fire function and make a twin cannon for your ship (Switch the left and right mouse clicks.)

 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code? End game when you die, you can still shoot after you lose. Show a proper screen.

 

What could have been clearer or better commented? It was well commented.

 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what? No, everything seems to run in order. 

 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE? Yes there is an appropriate license 

 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive? I think the README.md decribed everything the player was to expect. 

 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code. Good job on getting the enemy to fire back.
